# Would You Rather

This web app is my take on the classic Would You Rather game. Users can:

* Choose one of the two answers provided for the given question
* Add a new question for all other users to answer
* Keep track of their score as well as everybody else's on the Leaderboard

Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Let Me See It

To get started using the app:

* git clone or download the repo on your local machine
* open the terminal and navigate to the location of the repo
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start with `npm start`
